## Installation

### Using Docker (recommended)

1. Clone the repository

2. Build the Docker image

    ```bash
    ./tasks/docker_build.sh
    ```

3. Run the Docker container

    ```bash
    ./tasks/run_benchmark.sh
    ```

Note: The `./tasks/run_benchmark.sh` script mounts the current directory to the `/workspace` directory in the Docker container.
This allows you to edit the code on your host machine and run the code in the Docker container without rebuilding.

### Using Pip

We recommend using Python 3.8.10.

1. Install the package from PyPI

    ```bash
    pip install tabularbench
    ```

### With Pyenv and Poetry

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a virtual environment using [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with Python 3.8.10.

3. Install the dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

 ```bash
    poetry install
 ```

### Using conda

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a virtual environment using [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/) with Python 3.8.10.

    ```bash
    conda create -n tabularbench python=3.8.10
    ```

3. Activate the conda environment.

    ```bash
    conda activate tabularbench
    ```

4. Install the dependencies using Pip.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to use

### Run the benchmark

You can run the benchmark with the following command:

```bash
python -m tasks.run_benchmark
```

or with Docker:

```bash
docker_run_benchmark
```

### Using the API

You can also use the API to run the benchmark. See `tasks/run_benchmark.py` for an example.

```python
clean_acc, robust_acc = benchmark(
    dataset="URL",
    model="STG_Default",
    distance="L2",
    constraints=True,
)
```

### Retrain the models

We provide the models and parameters used in the paper.
You can retrain the models with the following command:

```bash
python -m tasks.train_model
```

Edit the `tasks/train_model.py` file to change the model, dataset, and training method.

## Data availability

Datasets, pretrained models, and synthetic data are publicly available [here](https://uniluxembourg-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/thibault_simonetto_uni_lu/EvkG4BI0EqJFu436biA2C_sBpkEKTTjA5PgZU_Z9jwNNSA?e=62a4Dm).
The folder structure on the Shared folder should be followed locally to ensure the code runs correctly.

**Datasets**: Datasets are downloaded automatically in `data/datasets` when used.

**Models**: Pretrained models are available in the folder `data/models`.

**Model parameters**: Optimal parameters (from hyperparameters search) are required to train models and are in `data/model_parameters`.

**Synthetic data**: The synthetic data generated by GANs is available in the folder `data/synthetic`.

## Naming

For technical reasons, the names of datasets, models, and training methods are different from the paper.
The mapping can be found in [docs/naming.md](docs/naming.md).
